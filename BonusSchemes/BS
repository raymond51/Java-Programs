a program that works out the amounts to pay out in a digital media companyâ€™s bonus scheme.
 Each employee is rated out of 10 by the bonus committee on two factors: profit the person
made and a rating of how hard they work.
The program converts these ratings in to a performance score and each bonus is calculated from it.
