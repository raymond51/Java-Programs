Scenario:

A new Paralympic relay competition involves competitors of different disability levels making up a team.
Runner's disablility is rated 4 times (4 different runners) with a 10 point system. If the the total runner team disability is less than 30 
then their team is valid.


Example of display:

What is the disability class of Runner 1? 10
What is the disability class of Runner 2? 7
What is the disability class of Runner 3? 7
What is the disability class of Runner 4? 6
That team has 30 points so is legal
